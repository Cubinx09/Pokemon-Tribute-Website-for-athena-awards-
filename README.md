# PC - for Athena Awards
My very first project for Athena Awards.

I chose to do one guided track project as a sort of foundation before diving head first into custom projects. I probably went overboard with it though. It's for everyone else to judge, ultimately >_>.

Anyways, this website (just simply called PC) is supposed to simulate the PC's in the Pokemon games. Somewhat. The index page is a simple page of the PC being "off" and once you turn it on by pressing the button that's in the middle of the page, it takes you to the rest of the website. 

The sidebar is very simple, only letting you get access to 3 webpages, one of which being a "log out" option, where it just takes you back to the index page.

The Pokemon Team page is of a trainer's "current" pokemon team. Current in brackets because, really, the team is made up of my personal favorites, alongside having nicknames that I have given them in-game. If you click on their images, it takes you to their actual Pokemon Database page, where you can learn all about them.

The Boxed Pokemon page doesn't have as much interactivity, but it does show a full box of pokemon the hypothetical pokemon trainer has. They have BOTH a Lugia and Giratina? They must be an expert! 

This project is mostly if not all flex containers. I once tried to make it a grid, but a couple hours in a realized a grid is too rigid for what I was trying to go for, so I just resorted to a flex container, something I have more expirience on anyways. Although, a grid display is used for the Pokemon Team, flex display wasn't helping. I also linked bootstrap to the project, but ultimately it's not doing much work in this project. Since I've wanted to simulate a computer, the edges of the webpages are now a border that can resemble a computer screen. The overall layout of the website is supposed to resemble that of the gen 3 PC boxes screen, but the radial blue background that you see can also be seen in Pokemon X and Y. So, ultimately, how the website looks is an almagamation of different PC box layouts from the actual games.

This project definetely helped me out in figuring which display is best suited for what. Although, making sure the images and the headings fit into the layout without messing everything up (like adding unneccessary height, leading to empty space if you scrolled down, or sideways) took a majority of the project's time. My solution to these issues might not be the best if you look at the code, but it works, and that's all that matters.

In my opinion though, this website looks exquisite, I'm really happy with how it turned out.

According to hackatime, this project took 8h 27m and 6s to complete.

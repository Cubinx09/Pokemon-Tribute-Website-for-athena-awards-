# Pokemon-Tribute-Website-for-athena-awards-
Very first project for the athena awards!

This is based off of the Guided Track where you could make a website that is a "tribute" to something that you like.

I chose the guided track for the first project because I wanted to make something based on a provided prompt before diving into custom projects.

Anyways, what I decided to do was base these webpages after the Pokemon PC. Although there's some creative liberties. The first webpage is a simple power on button, the second is showcasing the current pokemon team, and the third is all of the boxed pokemon available.

Since the PC in the games is a computer, I decided to make the borders of the webpages resemble that of a computer screen.

The overall layout is inspired by how the actual PC boxes layout are in the games, mainly the gen 3 games, with a sidebar showing the current pokemon you're hovering over (which I just made into a side menu) and the rest of the page showcasing the pokemon that you have.

The radial background of blue that you see when the PC is turned "on" isn't what you see in a PC when you play the games, but initally I was gonna make some pokedex, and many of the 3D games has blues for its pokedex backgrounds, so I decided to go with that. I did a change of plans, and the color scheme stuck.

I was planning to add more things, but I don't really think I have the expertise for it. It was a real struggle to make all the images fit in and not mess up the entire layout. That was probably what I spent a majority of the time doing. They are probably ways to optimize the code, since I think a lot of it is a hot mess, but I don't really know about that, and this website isn't going to work to well on mobile devices, I fear, because I don't really know how to do that.

As for the pokemon that are in the "Pokemon Team" tab, they're all pokemon that I consider my favorites, alongside having the nicknames that I have given them before when I play the games. Except the Xurkitree (Wattsman), I never caught a Xurkitree before.
As for the boxed pokemon, I tried to go for a more random approach but ultimately its just a bunch of pokemon that I have varying levels of affection for. All images you see come from official art or actual sprites that are in the game.

Even with the setbacks, I really liked how this website turned out.

According to hackatime, this project took 8h 26m and 56s to work on and complete.

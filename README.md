# Pokemon-Tribute-Website-for-athena-awards-
Very first project for the athena awards!
I chose the guided track for the first project because I wanted to make something based on a provided prompt before diving into custom projects.

Anyways, what I decided to do was base these webpages after the Pokemon PC. Although there's some creative liberties. The first webpage is a simple power on button, the second is showcasing the current pokemon team, and the third is all of the boxed pokemon available.

Since the PC in the games is a computer, I decided to make the borders of the webpages resemble that of a computer screen.

The overall layout is inspired by how the actual boxes look like in the games, a sidebar showcase the current pokemon you're looking at (although i just made that a side menu in my website) and all of the main content taking up the remainder of the screen (which in the games is just the boxed pokemon that you have). The radial blue that you see can also be seen in the PC background of the 3DS games. As for the start screen, its supposed to look like a turned off computer, and pressing the "power on" button...turns the PC on.

I was planning to add more things, but I don't really think I have the expertise for it. It was a real struggle to make all the images fit in and not mess up the entire layout. That was probably what I spent a majority of the time doing. There are probably ways to optimize the code, since I think a lot of it is a hot mess, but I don't really know about that, and this website isn't going to work to well on mobile devices, I fear.

As for the pokemon that are in the "Pokemon Team" tab, they're all pokemon that I consider my favorites, alongside having the nicknames that I have given them before. Except the Xurkitree (Wattsman), I never caught a Xurkitree before. You can click on the images and it sends you to their actual Pokemon Database page so you can know all about them.
As for the boxed pokemon, I tried to go for a more random approach but ultimately its just a bunch of pokemon that I have varying levels of affection for. All images you see come from official art or actual sprites that are in the game.

Even with the setbacks, I really liked how this website turned out.

According to hackatime, this project took 8h 27m and 6s to work on and complete.
